To use the code properly, you have to set the size function with {size((width of the image * 2),( height of the image));}, 
<br>
The var called factor, sets the color for being darker or brighter,
<br>  
A var called Scale, that sets the size of the pixels, 1 being the same size, 2 being half, 4 being 1/4 and so on,
<br>
I have used the Luis Miguel Maldonado's SLSO8 palette, https://lospec.com/palette-list/slso8
