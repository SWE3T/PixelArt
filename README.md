<div align="center">
To use the code properly, you have to set the size function with {size((width of the image * 2),( height of the image));}, 

There is a var called factor, that sets the color for being darker or brighter,
  
And a var called Scale, that sets the size of the pixels, 1 being the same size, 2 being half, 4 being 1/4 and so on,

I have used the Luis Miguel Maldonado's SLSO8 palette, https://lospec.com/palette-list/slso8

Feel Free to use!</p>
